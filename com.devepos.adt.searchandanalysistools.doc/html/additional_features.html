	In addition to the delivered Search and analysis capabilities the
	plugin additionally offers the following features

	<h3 class="heading">Executing Where-Used List from ABAP Quick Search Dialog</h3>
	<p>
		There are still some object types like e.g. <em>Authorization
			Object</em> for which there is no ADT editor available. So executing a <em>Where-List</em>
		for these objects is only possible if selected in an ADT editor like a
		<em>Class</em> or from the project explorer.
	</p>
	<p>For this purpose a new command is available via the main eclipse
		toolbar.

	<div class="alert info">
		<div class="alert-tip__text"></div>
		As it is a global command you can assign any free keyboard shortcut to
		this command
	</div>
	After executing this command an
	<em>ABAP Quick Search</em> Dialog opens where you can search for the
	object, for which you want to execute a
	<em>Where-Used</em>.
