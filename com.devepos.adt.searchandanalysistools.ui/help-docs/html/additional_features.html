	In addition to the delivered Search and analysis capabilities the plugin additionally offers the
	following features

	<h3>Executing Where-Used List from ABAP Quick Search Dialog</h3>
	<p>
		There are still some object types like e.g. <em>Authorization Object</em> for which there is no
		ADT editor available. So executing a <em>Where-List</em> for these objects is only possible if
		selected in an ADT editor like a <em>Class</em> or from the project explorer.
	</p>
	<p>For this purpose a new command is available via the main eclipse toolbar.

	<blockquote>As it is a global command you can assign any free keyboard shortcut to this command</blockquote>
	After executing this command an
	<em>ABAP Quick Search</em> Dialog opens where you can search for the object, for which you want to
	execute a
	<em>Where-Used</em>.
